# Random Python Scripts

This is my repo of random Python scripts that I've made. It could be simple/stupid or something complex/fancy.

## Scripts

### mOCk-sCrIPt.py

Know that Spongebob meme where he looks like a chicken and the text is in a mocking tone? This converts text to that format.

**Script was made on iOS using Pythonista. Relevant portions of the script have been commented to indicate that it's a Pythonista module.**
